            <p>The point of this game is to train the player to read RGB code correctly.</p>
            <p>Rgb is written as: RGB(Red, Green, Blue).</p>
            <p>The higher the number between the brackets the hue of that same number will be bolder (brighter).</p>
            <p><u>How the game works:</u></p>
            <p>◌ Read the RGB code written on the screen.</p>
            <p>◌ Press the circle you think holds that colour.</p>
            <p>◌ If you pressed the correct answer it will colour the others the same.</p>
            <p>◌ Else the circle you pressed will vanish from the screen.</p>
            <p>◌ To start another round or get different colours press the "RESET" button.</p>
